We use MIT License (At Appendix A) as default license for this repository.

But if a sub-directory has another license, that license is the true license for the source code that the directory contains.

For exmaple, each 3rd party library has its self license, haspart uses AGPL 3.0 as license, libhashpart uses LPGL 2.1 as license.
